### 1. Open Excel and Create a New Workbook

### 2. Import the Monte Carlo Summary
- Go to the `Data` tab in Excel, click `From Text/CSV`.
- Browse to `Desktop/DutchBay_FinModel_Package/outputs/montecarlo_summary_SAMPLE.csv` and import into a new sheet.
- Rename this sheet to `Summary`.

- Again, `From Text/CSV`.
- Browse to `Desktop/DutchBay_FinModel_Package/outputs/scenario_1_SAMPLE.csv` and import to a new sheet.
- Rename this sheet to `Scenario1`.

### 4. Apply Conditional Formatting on the Summary Sheet
- Select the `DSCR_min` column: Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule
    - Rule: Format cells less than 1.30 (red fill)
- Select the `OpCF_Y1` column: Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule
    - Rule: Format cells less than 0 (yellow fill)
- Select the `Equity_IRR` column: Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule
    - Rule: Format cells less than 6.5 (light blue fill)

### 5. Enable Filters and Pivot Tables for Deeper Audit
- Use Excel’s filter feature to quickly identify scenarios that fail any threshold.
- Use pivot tables or charts for scenario ranking or visual summary.

### 6. Save As `Audit_Template.xlsx` for re-use or distribution.

## What to Check in Your Audit
- Any scenario with `DSCR_min < 1.30` (red) is high-risk: not bankable, review causes.
- Negative values in `OpCF_Y1` (yellow) signal stress/unviable conditions.
- Low `Equity_IRR` (light blue) may fall short of sponsor requirements.
- On the `Scenario1` sheet, ensure all values look reasonable—no NaN, infinity, or negative where not expected.
- If you add your own scenarios, repeat for each new CSV.
