# How to Create the Ready-Made Excel Audit Workbook

The sample files generated for audit are now in the outputs folder:
  - montecarlo_summary_SAMPLE.csv
  - scenario_1_SAMPLE.csv

## Steps:
1. Open Excel > File > Open and select `montecarlo_summary_SAMPLE.csv` as a new worksheet.
2. Repeat for `scenario_1_SAMPLE.csv` creating a second worksheet.
3. Rename the sheets “Summary” and “Scenario1”.
4. Apply Excel conditional formatting:
   - Red for DSCR_min < 1.3 on Summary column H
   - Blue for Equity_IRR < 6.5 on column G
   - Yellow for OpCF_Y1 < 0 on column I
5. Save the workbook as `Audit_Template.xlsx`.

This provides instant visualization and filtering for investment risk and outputs. See also the included Excel_Audit_Guide.txt for additional analysis routines!
